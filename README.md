# Classification-Project
The goal of this project is to explore classification models, in order to find a model that predicts whether or not a customer will churn. In order to achieve this goal, the folllowing seven steps were performed:
 
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Cleaning and Preparataion
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Comparison
5. Evaluation using Cross-Validation
6. Final Model Selection
7. Making Predictions
